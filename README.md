# Flight-Price-Prediction
This is flight price prediction project that includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information on domestic flights in the United States. The file provides a brief overview of the dataset, the EDA process, and the conclusion.
# Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- Airline: The name of the airline
- Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey
- Source: The source from which the flight departs
- Destination: The destination of the flight
- Route: The route taken by the flight
- Dep_Time: The departure time of the flight
- Arrival_Time: The arrival time of the flight
- Duration: The duration of the flight
- Total_Stops: The total number of stops on the flight
- Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight
- Price: The price of the ticket (the target variable)

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis in this notebook includes the following steps:

- Data Cleaning: Check for and handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert datatypes where necessary.
- Data Visualization: Create visualizations to explore the relationships between the variables and the target variable, and identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Data Preparation: Prepare the data for modeling by encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

# Conclusion
This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the flight price dataset and identifies potential features that could be used to predict flight prices. It also outlines the steps necessary to prepare the data for modeling. The next step would be to build a predictive model using the insights gained from this analysis.
